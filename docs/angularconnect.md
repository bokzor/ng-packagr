## "...in Angular!"

#### left side: code file tree

```
 |- button.component.html
 |- button.component.scss
 |- button.component.spec.ts
 |- button.component.ts
```

#### right hand side: (~super duper picture of button~)

publish to npm repository

```ts
import { ButtonModule } from '@my/brand';
```


## But wait...

```ts
import { ButtonModule } from '@my/brand';
```

what does it actually mean?

Icon wall of tools: webpack, rollup, gulp, angular CLI, ember CLI, system.js

then fade in as last icon: bazel - uh, ah! yet another one!


#### So then came Angular Package Format

## Mamma mia! Here we go again!

rollup, scss, less, browserslistrc, tsc, ngc, AoT, FESM'15, module, typings, main, and on and on and on...


## I came for you!

the only slide on ng-packagr :-)

```
$ yarn add --dev ng-packagr
// edit ng-package.json
// create package.json
$ yarn package
// show file tree w/ generated dist folder
```
